# Why Reactive
* Massive firehoses of data, data is not static anymore
* Days or weeks if we fall behind
* Looking at 100% up-time
* Scripts and deploys still need to be run
* What we are trying to solve is the change in modern day users, need up-time to be extremly high if not perfect
* How long does it take for user to get a response, latency
* Users are looking for better and faster software

## Primary Goal
* The primary goal of reactive architecture is to provide and experience that is responsive under all conditions
